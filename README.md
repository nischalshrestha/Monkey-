**NOTE:** This is a personal project created for the sole purpose of learning how to build interpreters and compilers. You may borrow code under the licence. It will be unstable as I'm implementing Monkey. See progress below for usability.

### Progress

- [x] Interpreter
- [ ] Built-in types and functions
- [ ] Macros
- [ ] Compiler

### Future extensions
- [ ] Better error handling (stack trace)
- [ ] More operators like postfix (e.g. ++, --) or ternary
- [ ] Default arguments to functions 
- [ ] Macros hygiene 
- [ ] Debugging Macros
