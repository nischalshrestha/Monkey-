**NOTE:** This is a personal project created for the sole purpose of learning how to build interpreters and compilers. You may borrow code under the licence. I've completed implementing the interpreter for Monkey and plan to add in macros for it. After that, I will build a compiler for it.

### Dependencies

- Python 3.6+

### Progress

#### Interpreter

- [x] Interpreter
- [x] Built-in types and functions

#### Extras
- [x] Macros

#### Compiler

- [ ] Compile expressions
- [ ] Conditionals
- [ ] Data structures
- [ ] Functions
- [ ] Closures

#### Possible Future extensions
- Better error handling (stack trace)
- More operators like postfix (e.g. ++, --) or ternary
- Default arguments to functions 
- Macros hygiene 
- Debugging Macros
